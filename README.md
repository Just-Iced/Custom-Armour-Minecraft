# Custom Armour

Crafted diligently over a month and a half in 2023, the Minecraft Server
Plugin stands as a testament to my proficiency in Java programming and game
modification. Solely developed, this plugin enhances gameplay within Minecraft
by introducing custom-crafted armor types with unique functionalities. Each
armor set features distinct crafting recipes and in-game abilities tailored to
diversify player experiences. Notable examples include Blaze armor, enabling
players to emit fireballs in a circular pattern; Wooden armor, facilitating
forest clearing around the player; and Iron Golem armor, allowing for the
summoning of aggressive golems to engage targets. Additionally, the plugin
incorporates cooldown mechanisms for certain abilities, ensuring balanced
gameplay dynamics. With a wide array of custom armor types, including Cactus
armor, Feather armor, TNT armor, among others, the plugin enriches the
Minecraft experience with innovative gameplay mechanics.
